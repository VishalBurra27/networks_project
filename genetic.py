# Genetic Algorithm

# gene -> (client,server) ; client-index , server-value ; 
# 4- attributes: {client capacity, MIPS, current server load, maximum server capacity}
#data-type : 

# chromosome -> set of genes ;                           data-type : 

# population -> set of chromosomes                        data-type :

# No of servers, no. of clients
# initialize population
# Find fitness value for all the chromosomes in the population
# Select 2 at random and cross-over to produce a child
# check if the child has better fitness or not -> if yes the add it to population -> else add initial child
# return the chromosome with best fitness value
